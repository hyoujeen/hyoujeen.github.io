With Apple's WWDC25 approaching this upcoming week, my unrealistic(!) hope is that something akin to macOS's Terminal could be among the several macOS-like improvements promised for iPadOS.

When I was a young girl, I often logged into my family's bulky desktop monitor-keyboard setup to play <i>Oregon Trail</i>, <i>Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?</i>, and the like. Some today would call this computer model "vintage." Yet, it was on this "vintage" computer that I was introduced to programs that can help create tables of data and clusters of sentences such as Microsoft Excel and Microsoft Word, a couple of the most essential applications for workflows even in 2025. This was in the early 2000s. The "reign of the PC."

In the late 2000s and into the 2010s, things began to change. Schools started to replace PCs with white Macintosh desktops, and my school was one of them. Throughout my teens, the device I owned reflected the growing market shift from PCs to Apple products. I carried my MacBook all the way into college as Apple became part of the 21st century zeitgeist. macOS offered a clean, intuitive interface, required much less updates and restarts, and posed minimal concerns when it came to viruses and malware.

Most importantly, as I learned while studying computer science, macOS is built on a UNIX foundation. Nothing makes me happier than efficiently running commands on a Mac Terminal when I need to install packages with [homebrew](https://brew.sh){:target="_blank"} or run a Python script.

This is where I'm conflicted. <i>Which OS do I use?</i>

macOS clearly has numerous advantages. But, today's Windows PC laptops are catching up in competition with their AMOLED displays, 2-in-1 form factors, etc. <i>in addition to</i> their more readily available and customizable software (e.g., Microsoft Office applications) AND hardware. Broadly speaking, I would say it's a close call <i>at minimum</i> between Windows PCs and macOS computers. As someone who currently uses a Samsung laptop together with an iPad, however, I still find myself missing the benefits that macOS has to offer. iPadOS, while similar in ways to macOS, has its limitations.

I'd be excited to see Apple innovate further by bringing more macOS-like features to iPadOS. The latest iPad Pro model already has a stunning OLED display. If the iPad could function as a hybrid mix of tablet and computer, Apple might be able to match Windows PCs' 2-in-1 form factor. Although, the following question would remain for Apple in such a case: how much of an overlap between macOS and iPadOS would be justifiable from a development standpoint and in light of consumers' typical use cases?

Until that day comes, Windows 11 + Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) will keep me relatively content.

UPDATE on June 9, 2025: They did it! This year's changes to iPadOS brings iPadOS closer to macOS than ever before. Still no Terminal though...
