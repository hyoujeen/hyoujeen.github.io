My first computer was a Sony VAIO laptop running Windows Vista. And I loved it. At the time, it was high-tech, sleek, portable. Growing up, I was used to logging into my family's bulky desktop monitor-keyboard setup to play <i>Oregon Trail</i>, <i>Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?</i>, and the like. Some today would call this computer model "vintage." Yet, it was on this "vintage" computer that I was introduced to programs that can help create tables and strings of sentences such as Microsoft Excel and Microsoft Word, a couple of the most essential applications for workflows even in 2025. This was the early 2000s; the "reign of the PC."

In the late 2000s and into the 2010s, things began to change. Schools started to replace PCs with white Macintosh desktops, and my school was one of them. Throughout my teens, the device I owned reflected the growing market shift from PCs to Apple products. I carried my Macbook all the way into college as Apple became part of the 21st century zeitgeist. macOS offered a clean, intuitive interface, required much less updates and restarts, and posed minimal concerns when it came to viruses and malware. 

Most importantly, as I learned while studying computer science, macOS is built on a UNIX foundation. Nothing makes me happier than efficiently running commands on a Mac Terminal when I need to run a Python script. This is where I'm conflicted.

macOS has numerous advantages. But, given that today's Windows PC laptops, such as those manufactured by Samsung, are catching up in competition with their AMOLED displays, 2-in-1 form factors, etc. <i>in addition to</i> the more readily available and customizable software AND hardware, arguably, I would say it's a close call <i>at minimum</i> between PCs and Macs. 

Maybe one day, we'll have a device that takes Windows PCs' best features (e.g., AMOLED displays, Microsoft Office applications, breadth of customization) and combines them with a robust UNIX-based operating system and, by extension, a UNIX-based Terminal. While Windows does have its Subsystem for Linux (WSL), the feature has its limitations, one being that commands are executed much more slowly, especially when installing certain packages. 

As Apple's WWDC25 approaches this upcoming week, my unrealistic hope is that of the macOS-like improvements promised for iPadOS, something akin to macOS's Terminal is released. Such an upgrade would definitely take the iPad to new heights. Otherwise, it'd be nice to see Microsoft further improving upon WSL and its capabilities. Or I'll finally get around to installing Linux instead.
