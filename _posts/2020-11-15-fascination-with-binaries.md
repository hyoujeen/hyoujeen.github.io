Why do we give binaries so much power? What is it about them?

Some that come to mind are:

* Good vs Evil?
* Right vs Wrong?
* Heaven vs Hell?
* Success vs Failure?
* Rationality vs Emotion?
* Communism vs Democracy?
* Red vs Blue?
* Democrats vs Republicans?
* Blue vs Red?
* iPhone vs Android?
* 0 vs 1?
