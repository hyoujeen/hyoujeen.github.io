With Apple's WWDC25 approaching this upcoming week, my unrealistic(!) hope is that something akin to macOS's Terminal could be among the several macOS-like improvements promised for iPadOS.

Back when I was a child, the bulky desktop monitor-keyboard setup was the norm. Some today would call this setup "vintage." Yet, it was on this "vintage" computer that I was introduced to programs that can help create tables of data and clusters of sentences such as Microsoft Excel and Microsoft Word, a couple of the most essential applications for workflows even in 2025. This was in the early 2000s. The "reign of the PC." 

In the late 2000s and into the 2010s, things began to change. I observed schools, for one, replacing PCs with white Macintosh desktops as they followed the growing market shift from PCs to Apple products. Apple quickly became part of the 21st century zeitgeist. And macOS offered a clean, intuitive interface, required much less updates and restarts, and posed minimal concerns when it came to viruses and malware.

Most importantly (for me), macOS is built on a UNIX foundation. Nothing makes me happier than efficiently running commands on a Mac Terminal when I need to install packages with ```homebrew``` or run a Python script.

This is where I'm conflicted. I grew up on Windows but found convenience in macOS. Which OS would better serve my creative and technical needs?

macOS clearly has numerous advantages. But, today's Windows PC laptops are catching up in innovation with their AMOLED displays, 2-in-1 form factors, and more <i>in addition to</i> their readily available and customizable software (e.g., Microsoft Office applications + built-in macro system VBA, Windows CMD + WSL). Broadly speaking, I would say it's a close competition <i>at minimum</i>. 

Moving forward, I'd be excited to see Apple push the capabilities of their M chips to new heights by bringing more macOS-like features, including the Terminal, to iPadOS. The latest iPad Pro model already has a stunning OLED display. If the iPad could function as a hybrid mix of tablet and computer, Apple might be able to match Windows PCs' 2-in-1 form factor at the very least. Although, the question would remain for Apple: how much of an overlap between macOS and iPadOS would be justifiable from a development standpoint and in light of consumers' typical use cases?

Could Apple really make a "game-changing" move this time around? If so, could we see a merging of iPadOS and macOS some time in the future?

UPDATE on June 9, 2025: Wow, they actually brought iPadOS closer to macOS than ever before. Still no Terminal though... Maybe next year.
