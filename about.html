						        You Jeen is a consultant with The Kigumi Group focusing on the intersection of technology, ethics, and regulatory mechanisms (e.g., stakeholder approaches to AI ethics in East Asia).

A former Fulbright Scholar, You Jeen completed her research project in South Korea at KAIST’s Graduate School of Science & Technology Policy and KPC4IR, assessing the national government’s multi-stakeholder approach to 4IR and AI ethics at the intersection of technological innovation and government policy. She previously interned at Harvard’s Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society, exploring different components of internet law and legal pedagogy, and at a nationally recognized law firm in Manhattan.

She holds a B.A. in Computer Science and Philosophy from Smith College, where she completed an honors thesis addressing the relationship between causality and machine learning, investigating the weaknesses of current statistical practices used toward implementing explainable AI. As an undergraduate, she was also accepted to multiple conferences, including the international ETHICOMP computer ethics conference series. She studied abroad at the University of Oxford in Spring 2019, centering her studies on theoretical AI and philosophy of cognitive science.

Born in Seoul but raised in the U.S., You Jeen is proud of her Korean-American identity and, with this identity serving as the foundation, seeks to further cross-national communication and collaboration in technology ethics and policy through her work.
							    In her spare time, she enjoys watching movies, PC gaming, listening to K-pop, and relaxing with her family and pet chihuahua.
