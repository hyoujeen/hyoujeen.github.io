						        Last year, I was a Fulbright Scholar as a member of the 2020-2021 Fulbright U.S. Student Program. My research was in the field of Information Science in South Korea, assessing the country’s approach to the intersection of technological innovation and government policy with respect to the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Following my Fulbright fellowship, I intend to pursue the intersection
						        of technology policy and law. Prior to my Fulbright, I interned at Harvard’s Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society, exploring different components of internet law and legal pedagogy, and at a nationally recognized law firm in Manhattan. I also studied abroad at the University of Oxford, taking courses in AI, Knowledge Representation & Reasoning, and Philosophy of Cognitive Science. During my senior year, I completed an honors thesis addressing the relationship between causality and machine learning, investigating the weaknesses of current statistical practices used toward implementing explainable AI. Having graduated in May 2020, I hold a B.A. in Computer Science and Philosophy from Smith College. In my spare time, I enjoy watching movies, PC gaming, listening to K-pop, and relaxing with my family and pet chihuahua.
