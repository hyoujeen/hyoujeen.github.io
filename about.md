Starting this coming fall, I will be a law student at HLS! 

After graduating from Smith College with a double major in **Computer Science & Philosophy**, I examined and published on national **AI Ethics & Policy** initiatives in South Korea as a Fulbright Scholar. I also have a background in Responsible Tech consulting, researching the interplay between **Generative AI** and institutions that serve as key pillars of our society today (e.g., higher education, the law), and managing data operations.

Over the years, my papers have been accepted by international venues such as the ETHICOMP Conference and the ACM FAccT Conference.

In my free time, I dabble in photorealistic painting, take photos of nearby scenery, meditate, run with my dog, and experiment with the latest GenAI models.
