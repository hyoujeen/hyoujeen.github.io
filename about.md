Starting this coming fall, I will be a law student at HLS! 

I previously studied **Computer Science & Philosophy** at Smith College and abroad at the University of Oxford. In 2021, I was a Fulbright Research Fellow at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (KAIST) examining South Korea's multistakeholder policymaking approach to creating a national infrastructure for **AI Ethics & Policy** initiatives.

Over the years, I engaged with the fields of computer science, philosophy, and technology policy from different angles (e.g., character education, legal theory and governance, data operations). My academic research in a number of these areas has been accepted by international venues such as the ETHICOMP Conference and the ACM FAccT Conference.

In my free time, you can find me dabbling in photorealistic painting, taking photos of nearby scenery, meditating, and relaxing with my dog.
