> [T]he disciplines are the place where we begin, but not where we end.  <cite>― Allen F. Repko ―</cite>

Starting this coming fall, I will be a law student at HLS! 

I previously studied **Computer Science & Philosophy** at Smith College and abroad at the University of Oxford. In 2021, I was a Fulbright Research Fellow at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (KAIST).

I most enjoy examining issues concerning **AI Ethics & Policy** from multiple angles (e.g., character education, metaethics, legal theory and governance, business operations). Over the years, my academic research in a number of these areas has been accepted by international venues such as the ETHICOMP Conference and the ACM FAccT Conference.

In my free time, you can find me dabbling in photorealistic painting, taking photos of nearby scenery, meditating, running with my dog, and experimenting with the latest GenAI models.
