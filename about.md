> [T]he disciplines are the place where we begin, but not where we end.  <cite>― Allen F. Repko ―</cite>

I enjoy finding meaningful insights at the nexus of different disciplines. 

Starting this coming fall, I will be a law student at HLS! After graduating from Smith College with a double major in **Computer Science & Philosophy**, I researched national **AI Ethics & Policy** initiatives in South Korea as a Fulbright Scholar. I also, amongst other endeavors, explored the interplay between **Generative AI** and institutions that serve as key pillars of our society today (e.g., higher education, the law) as a staff researcher at the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society.

Over the years, my papers have been accepted by international venues such as the ETHICOMP Conference and the ACM FAccT Conference.

In my free time, I dabble in photorealistic painting, take photos of nearby scenery, meditate, run with my dog, and experiment with the latest GenAI models.
