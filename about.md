Starting this coming fall, I will be a law student at HLS! 

I previously studied **Computer Science & Philosophy** at Smith College and abroad at the University of Oxford. 

Examining issues concerning **AI Ethics & Policy** from multiple angles (e.g., character education and digital literacy, law, business) excites me the most. Over the years, my academic research has been accepted by international venues such as the ETHICOMP Conference and the ACM FAccT Conference.

In my free time, you can find me dabbling in photorealistic painting, taking photos of nearby scenery, meditating, running with my dog, and experimenting with the latest GenAI models.
