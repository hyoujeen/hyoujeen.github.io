> [T]he disciplines are the place where we begin, but not where we end.  <cite>― Allen F. Repko ―</cite>

Currently, I am a J.D. Candidate at Harvard Law School.

I previously studied **Computer Science & Philosophy** at Smith College and abroad at the University of Oxford. In 2021, I was a Fulbright Research Fellow at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (KAIST) examining South Korea's multistakeholder approach to enforcing **AI ethics principles** via policy and legislation.

Over the years, I engaged with the fields of computer science, philosophy, and technology policy from different angles (e.g., character education, metaethics, legal theory and governance, data operations). My academic research in a number of these areas has been accepted by international venues such as the ETHICOMP Conference and the ACM FAccT Conference.

In my free time, you can find me dabbling in photorealistic painting, taking photos of nearby scenery, meditating, relaxing with my dog, and jumping into a survival horror game every now and then.
