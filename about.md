Starting this coming fall, I will be a law student at HLS! 

I previously studied **Computer Science & Philosophy** at Smith College and abroad at the University of Oxford. 

Researching **AI Ethics & Policy** initiatives from multiple angles (e.g., digital literacy and ethics, law, business) excites me the most. Over the years, my academic research has been accepted by international venues such as the ETHICOMP Conference and the ACM FAccT Conference.

In my free time, I dabble in photorealistic painting, take photos of nearby scenery, meditate, run with my dog, and experiment with the latest GenAI models.
